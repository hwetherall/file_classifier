  "Memo - Overall": "Comprehensive overview. This summary is not chapter specific, it will be used for all chapters. The main goal is to remove noise and compose a concise, information rich summary. Points to focus on, if present: \n\n- Main arguments or conclusions\n- Emphasized information\n- Relevant data, figures, or facts\n- Stated recommendations or next steps if present\n- Business model and revenue streams\n- Financial performance, forecasts, unit economics\n- Market size, growth, competition, and customer insights\n- Product/technology overview and defensibility\n- Legal or regulatory issues\n- Risks, assumptions, and dependencies\n- Notable stakeholders, customers, or partnerships\n- Exit opportunities or strategic direction\n\nIf the document is divided by section, execute the summary section by section.\n\nIgnore:\n- Fluff or generic commentary\n- Omit generic filler and repetitive background info unless crucial for understanding.\n",
  "Opportunity Validation": "You will look for information relevant to a specific chapter: Opportunity Validation. The objective of this chapter is to validate if real, validated, and sufficiently urgent housing need exists and that Badiee Development has identified a clear, focused opportunity to serve that need through the Cherokee affordable housing project. This chapter establishes the foundation for accessing if this specific project is worth building now.\n\nCore Question of the chapter: Is there evidence of \"problem-solution fit,\" quantified demand validation, and favorable market timing that supports immediate development?\n\nThe information in the document might be or might not be relevant to this chapter. The summary should extract key information relevant to the chapter, and that includes:\n\n- CHAS/ACS household counts by income band (1-, 3-, 5-mile rings); HACLA voucher waitlist data; Supply gap calculations |\n- Bedroom mix vs. household size needs; Rent affordability at AMI levels; Transit/accessibility analysis \n- Competitive pipeline timeline; Policy/incentive expiration dates; Construction cost trajectories \n- Comparable absorption performance; Pre-leasing indicators; Voucher holder mobility data\n- Policy mandates/risks; Economic timing factors; Competitive capital analysis; NPV impact of delays\n- Housing Gap\n- Project milestones\n\n## Affordable Housing Opportunity Context\n\n### Demand Validation Framework\n- **Income-qualified households**: ≤60% AMI population analysis using CHAS/ACS data\n- **Voucher waitlist dynamics**: HACLA waitlist length, wait times, household formation rates\n- **Housing cost burden**: Families paying >40% income on rent, overcrowding rates\n- **Geographic concentration**: Demand density within transit-accessible areas\n\n### Solution-Fit Assessment\n- **Unit mix alignment**: Proposed bedrooms vs. household size distribution\n- **Affordability analysis**: Rent-to-income ratios at 50% and 60% AMI levels\n- **Location suitability**: Transit access given no-parking design constraint\n- **Amenity appropriateness**: Features matching target demographic needs\n\n### Market Timing Validation\n- **Policy catalysts**: ED-1 benefits, RHNA mandates, regulatory support windows\n- **Economic factors**: Construction costs, financing rates, competitive capital flows\n- **Pipeline analysis**: Competing deliveries, absorption capacity, market saturation risk\n- **Urgency quantification**: NPV impact of development delays\nREMEMBER you are a summary tool, this context is a reference for prioritizing what to extract. Do NOT make up information, do NOT add information, do NOT paraphrase, do NOT write analysis. Use always the exact words from the document.\n\nYou don’t need to fill the summary at any cost.Only include relevant information. If there is no relevant information at all just display 'No relevant information found in this document in the scope of the Opportunity Validation chapter.'",
